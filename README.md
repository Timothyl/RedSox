This is a simple app that I created to tell me when the RedSox have home games at Fenway.

I'm not really a baseball fan, but when the RedSox play at Fenway, the subway becomes REALLY crowded, so I try to avoid it.
I just wanted an easy way to quickly find out if the subway was going to be too crazy at rush hour.

I used Sinatra, basic CSS, Jquery/Javascript, as well as Heroku deployment.
